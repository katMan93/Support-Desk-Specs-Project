# Support-Desk-Specs-Project

Goal of this project is to create a web page / web app that will allow the user to have their system specs displayed.

User will be instructed to click on a button to check to see if their system / browser is optimal for Blackboard support / use. 
Once button is clicked, prompt will display and act like a sort of checklist for each feature.
Each line will outline the users:
  Operating System and version
  Browser 
  Is the user on mobile or not
  Java version on the borwser
  Cookies Enabled
  Popups Enabled
  Full User Agent (All info about the user) *Optional 
  
If a value returns false / not detected, a button should appear prompting and linking the user to download that extension (ex: Java)

**Note: Some browsers do not support Java, a prompt may be required to have it display this fact.
